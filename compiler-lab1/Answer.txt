Running your hello.c program in Windows is straightforward. Here's how you can do it:
- Open Command Prompt: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
- Navigate to Your Program's Directory: Use the cd command to change to the directory containing your hello.c file. For example:

cd C:\path\to\your\c\file

- Compile Your C Program: Use the gcc compiler to compile your program. If you haven't installed a compiler yet, you can download and install one like MinGW. Here's the command to compile your program:

gcc hello.c -o hello

- Run Your Program: After compiling, run your program by typing the name of the output file followed by .exe:

hello.exe

Your program should execute, and you'll see the output in the Command Prompt window. Remember to replace C:\path\to\your\c\file with the actual path to your hello.c file.
